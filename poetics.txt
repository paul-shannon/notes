  phytochrome poetics: light, branch and leaf in the forest
    a photoreceptor, a blue-green pigment found in many plants, in which it regulates various developmental processes.



  chromophore and chlorophyll poetics: light, leaf and branch in the forest

     In organic chemistry, a chlorin is a tetrapyrrole. Chlorins are partially hydrogenated versions of porphyrins. The
     parent chlorin is a rare compound, but substituted chlorins are common. Magnesium-containing chlorins are called
     chlorophylls. Chlorophylls are the photosensitive pigment in chloroplasts.

  chromophore poetics: light, branch and leaf in the forest
    A chromophore is the part of a molecule responsible for its color. The color that is seen by our eyes
    is the one not absorbed within a certain wavelength spectrum of visible light.
    From New Latin -phorus, from Ancient Greek -φόρος (-phóros, “bearing”), a derivative of φέρειν (phérein, “to bear, to carry”)
      compare anaphor: From Ancient Greek ἀναφορά (anaphorá, “a carrying back”), from ἀνά (aná, “up”) + φέρω (phérō, “I carry”).
                       a word or phrase that refers to an earlier word
                       or phrase (e.g., in my cousin said she was coming, she is used as an anaphor for my cousin ).

* kim stanley robinson in the new yorker (1 may 2020) "the coronavirus and our future"

  The critic Raymond Williams once wrote that every historical period
  has its own “structure of feeling.” How everything seemed in the
  nineteen-sixties, the way the Victorians understood one another, the
  chivalry of the Middle Ages, the world view of Tang-dynasty China:
  each period, Williams thought, had a distinct way of organizing
  basic human emotions into an overarching cultural system. Each had
  its own way of experiencing being alive.

* Phytochrome

 Phytochromes are a class of photoreceptor in plants, bacteria and fungi used to detect light. They
 are sensitive to light in the red and far-red region of the visible spectrum and can be classed as
 either Type I, which are activated by far-red light, or Type II that are activated by red light.[2]
 Recent advances have suggested that phytochromes also act as temperature sensors, as warmer
 temperatures enhance their de-activation.[3] All of these factors contribute to the plant's ability
 to germinate.

 they control many aspects of plant development. They regulate the germination of seeds
 (photoblasty), the synthesis of chlorophyll, the elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and
 number and movement of leaves and the timing of flowering in adult plants. Phytochromes are widely
 expressed across many tissues and developmental stages.[2]

 Other plant photoreceptors include cryptochromes and phototropins, which respond to blue and
 ultraviolet-A light and UVR8, which is sensitive to ultraviolet-B light.

 an important pigment that regulates photomorphogenic aspects of plant growth and
 development, such as seed germination, stem elongation, leaf expansion, formation of certain
 pigments, chloroplast development, and flowering.

  Good to Think With, Marjorie Garber

  In 1962, the French structural anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss
  coined the phrase “good to think with.” Scholars and theorists are
  drawn to this phrase, perhaps because it has certain validating
  power: It explains, or purports to explain, why we do what we do and
  why it matters. The phrase seems to explain the work of the
  humanities to the world—as if the humanities were not in the world,
  not the same as the world, not the language of the world. The actual
  citation is in Lévi-Strauss's book Totemism, first published in
  French in 1962 and translated into English the following year. The
  context is a discussion of what would come to be a central practice
  of structuralism: “How to make opposition, instead of being an
  obstacle to integration, serve rather to produce it.” Lévi-Strauss
  claims that “the animals in totemism” serve an intellectual and
  speculative function. They are not, or not only, objects of
  symbolism or identification, much less objects of culinary desire,
  but part of a structure of thinking.

* northrop frye's fictional modes

  in literary fictions the plot consists of somebody doing something. The somebody, if an
  individual, is the hero, and the something he does or fails to do is what he can do, or could have
  done, on the level of the postulates made about him by the author and the consequent expectations
  of the audience. Fictions, there fore, may be classified, not morally, but by the hero's power of
  action, which may be greater than ours, less, or roughly the same.

  - myth: If superior in kind both to other men and to the environment of other men, the hero is a
    divine being, and the story about him will be a myth in the common sense of a story about a
    god. Such stories have an important place in literature, but are as a rule found outside the
    normal literary categories.

  - legend, folk tale: If superior in degree to other men and to his environment, the hero is the
    typical hero of romance, whose actions are marvellous but who is himself identified as a human
    being. The hero of romance moves in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly
    suspended: prodigies of courage and endurance, unnatural to us, are natural to him, and
    enchanted weapons, talking animals, terrifying ogres and witches, and talismans of miraculous
    power violate no rule of probability once the postulates of romance have been established. Here
    we have moved from myth, properly so called, into legend, folk tale, marchen, and their literary
    affiliates and derivatives.

  - epic & tragedy: high mimetic mode.  if superior in degree to other men but not to his natural
    [33] environment, the hero is a leader. He has authority, passions, and powers of expression far
    greater than ours, but what he does is subject both to social criticism and to the order of
    nature. This is the hero of the high mimetic mode, of most epic and tragedy, and is primarily
    the kind of hero that Aristotle had in mind.

  - comedy & realistic fiction: low mimetic mode. If superior neither to other men nor to his
    environment, the hero is one of us: we respond to a sense of his common humanity, and demand
    from the poet the same canons of probability that we find in our own experience. This gives us
    the hero of the low mimetic mode, of most comedy and of realistic fiction. "High" and "low" have
    no connotations of comparative value, but are purely diagrammatic, as they are when they refer
    to Biblical critics or Anglicans. On this level the difficulty in retaining the word "hero,"
    which has a more limited meaning among the preceding modes, occasionally strikes an author.

  - symbol & genre:  five spheres.
    Frye also advocates a difference in the way a symbol is interpreted in connection with different
    genres. In the schema that he suggests for this purpose, he identifies five different spheres,
    namely, human, animal, vegetation, mineral and water. While humans in comedic work for
    fulfillment of wishes, in tragic it acts in a tyrannical way leading to isolation and
    downfall. Animals are gentle and pastoral in comedic while predatory in tragic. Vegetation is
    represented by the formations like gardens, parks and flowers in case of comic; in case of
    tragic, it is present in form of wild forest or barren land. Cities, temples, precious stones,
    etc. represent the mineral sphere in comedic which is represented by deserts, ruins and the
    likes in case of tragic. While the sphere of water is present in the form of rivers in comedic,
    it appears as floods, seas, etc.  So, the same spheres are to be interpreted in different ways
    and to the different effects in case of the comedic and the tragic works, respectively.

  - genres and seasons

    Frye has identified two major categories – comedic, further subdivided into comedy and romance;
    and, tragic, further subdivided into tragedy and satire. He has also identified a connection
    between various seasons and the different literary genres. For instance, he associates comedy to
    the season of spring, tragedy to autumn, satire with winter and romance to summer. He has also
    identified logic for this association. Comedy is basically about the birth and revival of the
    hero as spring is symbolic of victory over winter. Tragedy is associated to the downfall of the
    protagonist as autumn suggests the demise of the seasonal calendar. Satire depends on mockery
    and is concerned to insignificance of the hero. That is why it has been associated to winter,
    which symbolizes the absence of productivity. Similarly, summer refers to conclusion of the
    seasonal calendar as romance usually ends with an achievement, most commonly in the form of
    marriage.

   --- Degrees of Freedom: Living in Dynamic Boundaries, by Alan D M Rayner mycologist, recommened by anna tsing in her
   spore paper.

    Rayner’s Degrees of Freedom (1997b) considers how life forms of all sorts make their lives in indeter-
    minacy. Botanist Francis Halle ́ ’s In Praise of Plants (2002) offers related observations about indeterminacy in
    plants as a mode of living in free- dom. Such comments do not sit easily with powerful currents in Western
    philosophy. But consider those currents’ limitations. Thus Immanuel Kant, living under a repressive regime where
    many kinds of action were forbidden, imagined freedom as the human transcendence of nature through reason. Reasoning
    was one of the few kinds of actions he could get away with; other forms of action were blocked. Under another
    regime, might he have imagined fre2edom not just in passive thinking but rather in a fuller sense of living?

    More-than-Human Sociality: A Call for Critical Description, WithANNA TSING
    
     How could it have ever occurred to anyone that living things other than humans are not social? The more one thinks
     about it, the more ridiculous an opposition between human sociality and non-human-what?
     ‘non-sociality’?—becomes. If social means ‘made in entangling relations with signiﬁ cant others,’ clearly living
     beings other than humans are fully social-with or without humans. Yet, as this volume discusses, an opposition
     between nature and society has been quite conventional in the modern humanities and sciences. The opposition deﬁnes
     what we call the social sciences, which almost never deal with the intrinsic sociality of nonhumans, that is, those
     social relations that do not come into being because of humans. I was trained in this tradition too. I am
     embarrassed to see that, in my earlier work, I sometimes deﬁ ned social as ‘having to do with human histories.’ Now
     this seems quite strange. The concept of sociality does not distinguish between human and not
     human. ‘More-than-human sociality’ includes both.

    Patchy Anthropocene: Landscape Structure, Multispecies History, and the Retooling of Anthropology. 2019
      ~/Documents/Patchy...

      The Anthropocene deserves spatial as well as temporal analysis. “Patchy Anthropocene” is a conceptual tool for
      noticing landscape structure, with special attention to what we call “modular simplifications” and “feral
      proliferations.”  This introduction suggests guidelines for thinking structurally about more-than-human social
      relations; “structure” here emerges from phenomenological attunements to specific multispecies histories, rather
      than being system characteristics. Indeed, we discuss “systems” as thought experiments, that is, imagined holisms
      that help make sense of structure. Ecological modeling, political economy, and alternative cosmologies are systems
      experiments that should rub up against each other in learning about the Anthropocene. We address the misleading
      claim that studies of nonhumans ignore social justice concerns as well as suggesting ways that ethnographers might
      address“hope” without rose-colored glasses. This introduction offers frames for appreciating the distinguished
      contributions to this supplement, and it traces key changes in anthropological thinking from the time of this
      supplement’s predecessor, the Wenner-Gren Foundation–sponsored 1956 volume, Man’s Role in Changing the Face of the
      Earth. Rather than interrogating philosophies of the Anthropocene, the supplement shows how anthropologists and
      allies, including historians, ecologists, and biologists, might best offer a critical description.

     The Inevitability of Nature as a Rhetorical Resource, STEVE RAYNER, CLARE HEYWARD
   
     As an undergraduate philosophy student I was struck by the fact that philosophers throughout history consistently
     seemed to have had two sets of ideas: one consisting of ideas about how the world is, captured by ontology and
     epistemology, and another consisting of their ideas about how the world ought to be-a politics or ethics.1 The
     observation was not a novel one. Bertrand Russell (1946) makes a similar distinction in his magisterial History of
     Western Philosophy. But what struck me as particularly intriguing was the fact that any philosopher’s ideas about
     nature inevitably seemed to underpin and lend legitimacy to his or her moral or political preferences.

  I am writing a web app that displays the 3D structure of a bacterial
  phytochrome protein, from crystallography, a sandwich of helixes and
  sheets and coils. The meat inside is a small linear molecule, a
  chromaphor, like hemoglobin but stretched out, not a
  ring. positioned just so: a photon of red light puts a kink in the
  chromaphor. Like the princess and the pea, the kink gets noticed,
  and untold downstream reactions ensue, carrying the message
  (depending on other clues) red light!  Red light!  Grow! Bend!
  Flower!  Die!  Sprout!

  also to david george, who asks if this my motif everday.
  
  pretty much.  it fits in this way.  from northrop frye: tragedy is the hero’s separation from
  their society. comedy is reconciliation.  if hero=humans, and society=life-on-the-planet, then
  comedy becomes an option only after life-on-the-planet is admirable, intricate, worthy.  otherwise
  we have only the hero of epic and quest, establishing their worth against a barren background.
  the poetics of light (in the forest, especially in an undomesticated forest) is one way to
  understand that the background (the society) in which we live is not barren, but alive, ancient,
  intricate, way more complex and subtle than that which we usually valorize, see as valiant.  yep,
  it’s my theme and motif!

  yesterday, walking in the woods, and having tried again (and failed
  again) to read Bachelard’s Poetics of Space, I got a new idea about
  this project of mine.  Bachelard (were it not for his impenetrable
  Frenchy hifalutin language) - in a down-to-earth way he celebrates
  the beauty of domestic spaces: porches, bookshelves, light coming in
  through the window.  I think his idea is that structures create
  beautiful spaces, just like well-chosen words (structure of another
  sort) creates powerful meaning.

  so my thing is something like the poetics of forest light.  from
  molecule to leaf and branch.
