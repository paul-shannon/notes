  However, as evidenced by our inability to predict in vitro binding
  derived from high-throughput assays such as PBMs or SELEX-seq
  experiments, combinatorial factors are not the only culprit. A
  second challenge lies in building computationally tractable,
  physically plausible models. For example, commonly used position
  weight matrix (PWM) methods depend on correctly aligned DNA
  sequences and make the unrealistic assumption that each nucleotide
  binds to the TF independently of one another. Accordingly, a variety
  of methods have been proposed that attempt to expand this
  approximation (Barash et al., 2003; Sharon et al., 2008; Zhao et
  al., 2012; Zhou and Liu, 2004).

  Dependencies between nucleotide positions in a TF binding site can
  be explicitly encoded through k-mers, for instance dinucleotides or
  trinucleotides (Gordân et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2012). On the
  other hand, because stacking interactions between adjacent base
  pairs give rise to three-dimensional DNA structure, DNA shape
  features represent an alternative approach for encoding nucleotide
  dependencies implicitly (Zhou et al., 2015). Recent evidence
  suggests that a crucial aspect of TF binding can be explained based
  on the DNA shape of selected targeted sites (Rohs et al., 2009)

* Transcription factor–DNA binding: beyond binding site motifs

  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5447501/

  Sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene
  expression by binding to cis-regulatory elements in promoter and
  enhancer DNA. While studies of TF–DNA binding have focused on TFs'
  intrinsic preferences for primary nucleotide sequence motifs, recent
  studies have elucidated additional layers of complexity that
  modulate TF–DNA binding. In this review, we discuss technological
  developments for identifying TF binding preferences and highlight
  recent discoveries that elaborate how TF interactions, local DNA
  structure, and genomic features influence TF–DNA binding. We
  highlight novel approaches for characterizing functional binding
  site motifs that promise to inform our understanding of how TF
  binding controls gene expression and ultimately contributes to
  phenotype.

*  How motif environment influences transcription factor search dynamics: Finding a needle in a haystack

  Iris Dror  Remo Rohs  Yael Mandel‐Gutfreund

  Transcription factors (TFs) have to find their binding sites, which
  are distributed throughout the genome. Facilitated diffusion is
  currently the most widely accepted model for this search
  process. Based on this model the TF alternates between
  one‐dimensional sliding along the DNA, and three‐dimensional bulk
  diffusion. In this view, the non‐specific associations between the
  proteins and the DNA play a major role in the search
  dynamics. However, little is known about how the DNA properties
  around the motif contribute to the search. Accumulating evidence
  showing that TF binding sites are embedded within a unique
  environment, specific to each TF, leads to the hypothesis that the
  search process is facilitated by favorable DNA features that help to
  improve the search efficiency. Here, we review the field and present
  the hypothesis that TF‐DNA recognition is dictated not only by the
  motif, but is also influenced by the environment in which the motif
  resides.

* DNA Shape Features Improve Transcription Factor Binding Site Predictions In Vivo

  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471216302186

  Interactions of transcription factors (TFs) with DNA comprise a
  complex interplay between base-specific amino acid contacts and
  readout of DNA structure. Recent studies have highlighted the
  complementarity of DNA sequence and shape in modeling TF binding in
  vitro. Here, we have provided a comprehensive evaluation of in vivo
  datasets to assess the predictive power obtained by augmenting
  various DNA sequence-based models of TF binding sites (TFBSs) with
  DNA shape features (helix twist, minor groove width, propeller
  twist, and roll). Results from 400 human ChIP-seq datasets for 76
  TFs show that combining DNA shape features with position-specific
  scoring matrix (PSSM) scores improves TFBS predictions. Improvement
  has also been observed using TF flexible models and a
  machine-learning approach using a binary encoding of nucleotides in
  lieu of PSSMs. Incorporating DNA shape information is most
  beneficial for E2F and MADS-domain TF families. Our findings
  indicate that incorporating DNA sequence and shape information
  benefits the modeling of TF binding under complex in vivo
  conditions.
